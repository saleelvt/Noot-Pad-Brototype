-> Efficient Updates  :{when a array of elements chenges react need the why to find very efficiently for update the ui without rerendering }

=> diffrence between props and state 
->  create two component and paass data from child to parent 
-> prevent duplicate task in todo app 

=> react features 
------------------
-> declarative , components based ,virtual dom ,jsx ,performance ,simplcity 

   Dom                                                virtual dom 
-------------------------------------------------------------------
* tree representation of dom            | * light weight copy of orginal dom 
* re-renders all entire dom             | * only re-render hte chenged elements 
* update are heavy weight               | * updated are lightweight 
* performence low ux qality is low      | * performance is fast and ux is optiixed 
* not efficient work                    | * highly efficient
