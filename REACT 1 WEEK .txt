REACT 
-----
=> React is a open source library for building user interfaces like used to front end development used with javaScript 
=> react is component based architecture 
-> not a framwork 
-> focus on Ui {user inter faces }
-> react introduced face book  and maintained 
-> huge community 
-> components can be use with any library like angular , vue : that indication reusable code of react 
-> react is single page application 



react is declarative 
--------------------
=> that indicating if you want a ui then tell react what you want and react and react dom library  will build the actual UI 
=> react will handle efficiently updating and rendering of the components 
=> dom updates  are handles gracefully in react 
=> react is declarative : { developers can give the instraction to react shoul the ui like this } 
-. dom updation 
=> imparative paradigm  :{ say for creation }
=> react native for build the mobail app

* unmount   :{ remove a component our code

-> react routing 
----------------
=> routing is the best way for avoid the rendering 
-> we can simply change our pages without refresh actually the react work only one htlm page we just change the page components accordingly
=> controlled : In a controlled component react, state handles all the form data 
=> uncontrolled : , the HTML form element data is managed by only the DOM
=> Lazy loading in React allows you to split your code into smaller chunks, loading only the code that is needed for a 
particular part of your application when it is actually required

=> single page application and multiplage  

=> dom objenct :{head body and div class h1 like this 
diffing :{component compare cheythe maatunnu
