git and github { git is the sistum tool that went to  

-> git is a tool in our computer 
-> git network illathe work cheyam 
-> we can use the git all programs like python , mern ,flutter { its not spesiphic language }
-> the git analysing all movement of our in code line by line


=> The benefits of git 
   -------------------
=> Tracing history 
   ---------------
->   we can just use track our history use with only silgle c0mant 
=> Collabration 
   ------------
-> assum we are using a big project so we can use the multiple integration in our code 
-> mixing any code with our code

=> Backup 
  -------

 -> we can just use the back up in our code from anywhere
=> multiple features
  ------------------
-> we can use with the any project with same time 
=> Tracking Status 
   ---------------
-> if i forgot where i reach my previos project i can use this comant {git stash}
-> if crashed your project when you doing code that time it moere usage will be you can jut user ths 

=> we can use with open sorce project 
=> the actual  or commen name of this  is the git and mercurial { vertion controller system }
=> we want to lead our project so you just learn git 

=> 2 Types of Vertion Controlle Systum 
  ------------------------------------
1 - CVCS (Centralized VCS )
2 - DVCS (Distributed VCS )                                 
 
=> we can use the git 2 ways 
---------------------------
-> git init and git clone {git init aavumbol first project cheyyumbol cheyyanam / git clone ningal cheytha project eduth cheyyan ubayoogokkunnu}

=> * ls -> for showing files 

=> git init 
=> git status 
=> git commit
=> git branch -m {eny name } nammal oru puthiya repository start cheythe nammal gitil push cheyyumbol defalt branch mati nammak ishtamullath vach tharum 
=> git remote rename origin newname{ first cheyyumbo anmmale name origin enn ullath mati ishtamullath aka veedin aan }

=> cach /staging / Indexing 
-> add cheytha onnine matrame nammak commit adikkan patu
-> git tree is  add-status- chach/id -header/master
=> head means that represending which you existing now your code 
=> git log {etra commit undenn kaanan veendi yan ubhayoogikkunnath}
=> git log 
=> git log --all/dott .  {ellam}

=> git config systetil oru vattam cheytha mathi

=> BRANCHING
   --------
=> we just do create a new branch 
-> git branch {name of the branch}
=> eath branchil aano nilkunnath avide matraman change undakunnath

=> Merge 
   -----
 when we do  merging head aakiyath vachan cheyya 
-> and NAMMAl just labal matunnu
=> git merge {which is that name }=> it fast forward merge aan
-> git branch {ithe cheythal nammak nilavil nilkunna branch kittum
-> git diff{2 file diffrence manassilasan puthi yath vannath kanan patum}
-> git stash { this we can just go to our previous  commit cheythat aan patullu}
-> recursive merge and fast forward merge  {onn labal matunu mateeth 2 ennavum koodi veere oru   }

=> conflit {ore filelil kore developers work cheyyumbol merge cheyyumbol eath edukanam eath ozhivakanam enn nokunnath}
=> we can just add that name from one name to anothor name 



Git Hub 
-------

we can just create a repositary in our Git Hub and create a name take  link with https
=> and just create in your  terminal and git remote add {file name} and that link https://....

=> git remote add {name of that filenam} {linke}
*  git remote
*  git remote -v {path kanikkan}
* git clone {nammal edutha link copy cheyya}

* => git fetch {the commant retrieves the latest changes from a remote repository}
* => git merge : After fetching the changes, you typically want to integrate them into your local working branch.
* => The git pull command is used to fetch and download content from a remote repository and immediately update 
     the local repository to match that content
* =>  A firewall is a network security device and  controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules
  ->  The three main types of firewalls (packet-filtering, stateful inspection, and proxy)
