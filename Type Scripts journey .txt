Type Scripts journey 
-------------------
* js is a weakly/looser  typed language 

=> Type Scripts is a Super set of the java Script 
-> it will increase our code performance 
-> it will indicate the error like a div 
-> this compilation remove the all types 

=> we can install the type script as we want to our project 
=> and if you want install globally : { npm install typescript -g }

infer types / implicit types 
----------------------------
=>  If you are change the type of let value : { let username ='Saleel ' to username=10 } 
 -> it will indicate error message on your display 
-> we cannot able to change any data type we are already declared 

* we can do the type script without setting the type 

Defining Types (Explicit Types )
--------------------------------
 -> let username : string='Saleel'
-> let number: number=21
-> let skills :string[] =['typewriter','logical Operator, 'content creator']
-> let object : string{name:string ,age:number}
-> object use cheyyumbol nammak suggestion aayi varum 

interface property 
------------------
-> it is used for object details we can set multiple places 
-> as we want 

* when we are declare a function inside of a object we want to wright like this 
  { getName : ()=> void  }  void kodukkanan with function name 

* union operator 
----------------
-> if you want declare multiple data type like :{let age : string | number} ='forteen '
